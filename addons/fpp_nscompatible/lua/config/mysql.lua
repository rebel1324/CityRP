In this file you can find a manual for MySQL configuration and the MySQL config settings.

MANUAL!
HOW TO USE MySQL FOR FPP!
Download andyvincent's gm_MySQL OO module to your hard drive:
http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=933647

Unpack it

on the SERVER:
    - Put libmySQL.dll in the same folder as HL2.exe OR srcds.exe (e.g srcds\orangebox OR steamapps\username\garrysmod)
    - Put gmsv_mysqloo.dll in garrysmod\lua\includes\modules\. If any of those folders don't exist, create them.
        You can also copy and paste the lua folder from the download to garrysmod/
    - Make sure the configurations in this file (_MySQL.lua) are set up correctly
    - TIP: Make this file read-only so it doesn't get changed in an SVN update!
        But if you get problems with the MySQL database, remove this file, update from SVN and set it up again, things might change in the SVN!



WHAT TO DO IF YOU CAN'T GET IT TO WORK!
    - There are always errors on the server, try if you can see those (with HLDS)
    - make sure the settings in this file (_MySQL.lua) are correct
    - make sure the MySQL server is accessible from the outside
